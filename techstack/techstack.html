    In the Tech World, you will be encountering a lot of new words and terminologies to define the work you are working on. Along the Bootcamp, we are going to focus on Web Development, which is the process of creating websites. What is the main terminology in this domain ?

    <h2>BACK VS FRONT!</h2>
    The two main areas in the web development, but what serves what?

    <h3>Front End</h3>
    Part of the website that is in charge of presenting the information to the user. Any website meant to be read by a human user needs a Frontend part. Usually means HTML, CSS and JavaScript although in broader terms, frontend can also refer to server-side rendering with a Backend language like PHP. Code runs in the client's browser.

    <h3>Back End</h3>
    Part of the website that is in charge of managing the information that is supposed to be presented to the user and the information that the user sends to the server. Any website that needs storing data and any website that contains an indefinite number of records of the same type needs a backend part. Usually means a server-side programming / scripting language like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript (NodeJS), .NET, Java and others together with a database engine / language like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB etc. In broader terms backend can also encompass managing of the server using knowledge of operating systems (especially Linux), server softwares (Apache, NGINX, IIS, ...) and others (mailservers, firewalls, etc.) Runs on the server.

        <h2>WHAT ARE THE MAIN TECHNOLOGIES WE ARE GONNA BE USING ?</h2>
    
        <h3 id="html">HTML</h3>
        The markup language used to give structure to documents on the Internet. Currently in version 5.
    
        <h3 id='css'>CSS</h3>
        The language used to specify the presentation of documents on the Internet (i.e. how they will look like) Currently in version 3.
    
        <h3 id="js">JS</h3>
        The most popular language today. Can be used in the frontend, in the backend (NodeJS) and for querying a database (MongoDB). The most common use is on the frontend, providing dynamic behavior to the website, allowing it to behave more like a desktop application. Currently in version ES2019/ES10.
    
        <h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
        A server-side scripting language. The most widespread language of its kind (over 70% market share). A great starting point to backend programming. Arguably its biggest drawback is its wild beginnings and the legacy that it carries over from that time. Its biggest advantage is the enormous ecosystem and community around it and the low cost of running a PHP application. Currently in version 7.
    
        <h3>MySQL</h3>
        A database engine and also a language to communicate with it. Not as multifunctional as PostgreSQL and other engines but often the fastest. You may also know MariaDB, a community-developed fork of MySQL, created in fear of losing MySQL before it was bought by Oracle. Feature-wise, MySQL and MariaDB are almost equal. Currently in version 8 (MySQL) and version 10 (MariaDB).
    
        <h3>Laravel</h3>
        The most popular PHP framework. Very capable, borrows the best parts from other frameworks (Symfony) and adds its own structure and features.
    
        <h3>React</h3>
        The most popular JavaScript framework / library today. Meant for the development of great, friendly user interfaces. Nowadays used to create entire websites and even native mobile apps.
